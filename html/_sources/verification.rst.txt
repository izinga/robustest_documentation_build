RobusTest provides you a means to compare attribute values of an element with:-

a. a custom value ; Or;
b. that of the attribute value of another element

We refer to this process as a **verification**

A verification is done by comparing a **'Source'** attribute value with a **'Target'** attribute value.

When a verification is recorded, a corresponding test step is created.

Details of the verification can be seen in the 'User Data' section of the verification test step that is recorded.
