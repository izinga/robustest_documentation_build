Introduction
============

RobusTest is the app testing platform for all things mobile. Internally, we like to call it the Swiss Knife for Mobile App Testing. 

RobusTest is designed to be a one stop platform for everyone involved in creating a mobile appication - right from business stakeholders who need to see what their application looks like, to developers who need to run some quick checks to testers who need to test the app extensively using manual and automated methods. Some important features of RobusTest are

* Testing on real devices

* Performance-first approach to manual and automated testing

* Simulate real life scenarios for meaningful testing

* Automate your tests and make them data-driven without writing any code

* Run your automated tests on multiple devices in parallel

* In-depth test reports including both funtional and performance test results

* Run your own automated tests on the devices connected to the platform
