**6. Location Simulation**

This feature allows you to test as if the device is present at a different location than where it actually is. This is done by  simulating the location on the device.

*Pre-requisites*:

  On the device:

    1. in Developer options:
       * enable 'Mock Locations'
       * set the Nizedha app as your mock location app
    2. in 'Locations', set the 'Location Mode' to 'Device only'


Once the pre-requisites have been met, you can simulate any location as follows:

 1. Click on the 'Set Location' button on the header
 2. Type the name of the location in the 'Search location here' field and select from the drop down. Alternatively, you can manually pin the location of your choice on the map
 3. Once your location has been pinned, click on the 'Set Location' button

Your device will now behave as if it is situated at the location chosen by you.

A corresponding 'Set Location' test step is seen created in the test step table. 

You can change the location setting by modifying the latitude and longitude values specified in the 'User Data' section of the recorded test step.
